# Agnes-kitchen-legacy
A mother-daughter open-source project to preserve and celebrate my mom, Agnes's Malaysian cooking recipes, with plans to use AI to generate new recipes in her cooking style.

- Photo upload capability (up to 5 photos per recipe)
- Admin dashboard for review and editing
- Public gallery organized by category (chicken, fish, vegetables, mutton, other)

### Phase 2: AI Recipe Generation
- Analyze cooking patterns and style
- Generate new recipes based on Agnes's style
- (Coming after 100+ recipes collected)

## Tech Stack
